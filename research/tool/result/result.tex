\section{Result}
In this section different tools will be described, their test result presented and the general information of them summarized.

\subsection{Wacom sign pro PDF}
This tool is provided by the company Wacom, which is the customer previously thought for the bachelor project. At the moment there is an \gls{app} available, that signs documents with a \gls{bs} \parencite{wacom2018pdf}. Currently Wacom develops an \gls{sdk} based on the \gls{app}, therefore is no testing possible. The information presented in table \ref{tab:wacom} are from the internet and a product presentation from first March 2018 at the Wacom site in DÃ¼sseldorf. \newline

%		Usage without license & At the moment not clear. The \gls{app} currently has a free version, but with limited usage.\\ \hline
%		Devices independent & \\ \hline
%		Integration possible & \\ \hline
%		Certified & The software uses the \gls{bs} and \gls{aes}. Currently there is no defined status by the government for the \gls{bs}. But in combination with the \gls{aes} it has a legal status. \\ \hline
%		Easy usage & Select field(s) to enter data and sign with the pen, press button to agree and then enter mail to sharing. It is not described if a company stamp could be inserted.\\ \hline
%		Costs & Unclear, due to the fact that the \gls{sdk} is not published and no pricing is published.\\ \hline
%		Accepted documents & \Gls{pdf}\\ \hline
%		Amount of accounts & At the moment also unclear due to the fact that the usage requirements are not published. The \gls{app} currently allows more than 5000 in one environment. \\ \hline

Due to the fact that the knockout criteria are not fulfilled at the moment, no further research was done.

\subsection{DocuSign}
This tool is already in usage at \gls{cc}, but not always and with a lot of manual actions and missing things like the company stamp. During the testing a lot of functionalities were figured out. The test protocol is placed in the appendix \ref{sec:docusign}. The table \ref{tab:docusign} below will give a short summary about the test result and other aspects figured out during the research.

\begin{table}[h!]
	
	\begin{tabular}{|p{4cm}|p{10cm}|} \hline
		Criterion & Fulfillment \\ \hline
		Integration &  A \gls{sdk} available within the \grqq Business Flex\grqq packet of the provider or a higher one. Also an integration is possible with Google applications and JIRA, which are both used by \gls{cc}. \parencite{docusign2018integration,docusign2018formats,docusign2018google,docusign2018jira}. \\ \hline
		Device independent & Online available, also a \gls{app} is accessible for all \gls{os} of smartphones \parencite{docusign2018mobile}. It provides the same functionalities as the web application. \\ \hline
		Usability &  The fields need to be set manual, it need to be checked if it possible to customize it. Furthermore it is possible to track activities, assign signer, add the company stamp, transfer the signing responsibility, decline the signing and to sign the document manual and scan it then. \\ \hline
		Costs & The signing itself costs nothing.\\ \hline
		Accepted file formats & PDF \& Microsoft Word accepted, Open Office Writer is not accepted. Moreover, the maximum accepted size of a file is 25 \gls{mb}. \parencite{docusign2018formats}\\ \hline
		Operating mode & The tool is as \gls{saas}, \gls{op} or a combination of both available. \parencite{docusign2018op,docusign2018saas} \\ \hline
		Additional security & Access code, SMS, phone call or certificate exists for multi-factor authentication. Moreover, a knowledge based authentication is available, where an information from the past of the signer is requested. \parencite{docusign2018security} \\ \hline
		Legal aspects & DocuSign satisfies the standards of the \gls{eidas} and more security standards \parencite{docusign2018certificates,docusign2018legal}. \\ \hline

\subsection{HelloSign}
The online tool HelloSign is used at the subsidiary company Istana of \gls{cc}. Therefore, it should also taken into account. Not all functionalities could be tested through the fact that for the business version data were requested, the tester was not allowed to give. The result of the test is documented in appendix \ref{sec:hellosign} and a summary of it together with additional information collected from an online research is given in table \ref{tab:hellosign}.
\begin{table}[h!]
	
	\begin{tabular}{|p{4cm}|p{10cm}|} \hline
		Criterion & Fulfillment \\ \hline
		Integration & HelloSign has an \gls{api} with different version provided, included there are several functionalities. Moreover, integration exists for Google services like Google Suite and for several other business applications e.g. HubSpot CRM or Slack, which are used at \gls{cc}. Additionally third party integrations are possible with Zapier, a tool for modeling business processes. \parencite{hellosign2018integration,hellosign2018api}\\ \hline
		Device independent & The tool is online available. Furthermore, exists an \gls{app} for Android and iOS, but it has not the same functionalities as the online platform. It allows only the scanning of documents ans sign them. \parencite{hellosign2018legal}\\ \hline
		Usability & It is simple to upload a document and sign it, due to the fact that there is intuitive handling. Not all functionalities like branding and company stamp could be tested, because of the non usable test version of higher plans. The fields required for signing need to be set manual and there is not that much choice of fields. In the case the \gls{app} is used, only the creation of a signing process could be done.\\ \hline
		Costs &  Signing without costs is possible, but the creation and preparation cost. \\ \hline
		Accepted file formats & HelloSign accepts several file formats. In the test the formats \gls{pdf}, Microsoft Word and Open Office Writer was accepted. The maximal amount of a pages a document is 500 pages or a file size of 40th \gls{mb} \parencite{hellosign2018documents}.\\ \hline
		Operating mode & In general the system is available in \gls{saas} mode. \parencite{hellosign2018features} \\ \hline
		Additional security & To verify the authentication HelloSign has two options: the two-factor authentication and the password protection signature request.\parencite{hellosign2018security} \\ \hline
		Legal aspects & The tool fulfills the requirements of the \gls{eidas} regulations of the \gls{eu} and can be used in the \gls{usa} \parencite{hellosign2018legal} \\ \hline
