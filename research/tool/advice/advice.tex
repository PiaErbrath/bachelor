\section{Advice}
Based on the defined criteria of the company the advice would be to use the tool SignNow, because it got the most points as can be seen in table \ref{Tab:comp}. But it is not clear if the usage of the web application is included. Moreover, was the contact with the tool provider only via mail and not any phone call or video conference was scheduled to clarify misunderstandings or unclear things, like concrete use cases. 

Therefore, it would be advisable to choose the tool DocuSign, it fulfills all criteria and the most with full satisfaction. Furthermore, is a German-speaking support available and \gls{cc} can choose where to store the data in the \gls{eu}. It is the only tool that has the company stamp usage and has already some integration for the Google Suite. Additional a two-factor authentication for the signing process is available.
