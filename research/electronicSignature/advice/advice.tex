\section{Advice}
In general need to be said that \glspl{es} are a good alternative for handwriting signatures, especially in \gls{eu} states. The focus is on the type of \gls{es}. The result from the comparison in section \ref{sec:comp} is that the \gls{qes} fits the requirements explained in section \ref{Tab:criteria} best. Also from the legal aspect would it be the best solution, cause of the fact that it is equated to the written signature in the most cases. Even customers with a high demand on legal aspects will be satisfied with that signature, cause of the possibility to track document changes after the signing and the identification of the signers.
