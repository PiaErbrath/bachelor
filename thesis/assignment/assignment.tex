 This chapter gives an overview about the bachelor thesis project. Therefore, the problem ans the assignment are explained, the scope and the phases are defined and finally the motivation behind the project is documented.
 
 \section{Problem Description}
 The first plan was to create a \gls{cms} for the customer Wacom, which produces among others the technology and hardware for mobile devices and Windows operating systems that can be used to make graphics or to sign documents \parencite{wacom2018about}. But currently they develop a new \gls{SDK} of their \gls{app} \textit{sign pro PDF}, which allows the signing of documents on a mobile phone with their pen hardware technology\parencite{wacom2018sign}, that will be finished earliest in July 2018 and the \gls{cms} should be build on that \gls{SDK}. Due to the fact that the bachelor thesis project ends at the beginning of July 2018 it is not doable at all.
 
 Then a contact to the Finance and Sales department of \gls{cc} was made. They currently want to set up a new \gls{erp}, because the old \gls{erp} does not fit the requirements anymore. One big aspect for them is to reduce the paper work and automate or simplify several processes regarding making quotes, orders and invoices, starting projects and storing data at only one point for all departments. At this point a \gls{cms} would make sense that can interact with the new \gls{erp}.

 \section{Assignment Description}
 The idea of the task is to introduce the \gls{es} with a general usage by \gls{cc}. Currently they use the \gls{es} partly, but not in all areas possible.
 This means that all possible contracts and quotes should be signed with the \gls{es} and stored digital, so that the paperless office can be created. Included in the task is the creation of a workflow, that automates the process of subscribing regrading the signing guideline of \gls{cc} so that cost for managing could be reduced and the response time is increased. Due to the fact that \gls{cc} introduce a nre \gls{erp} this year. It will be only a proof-of-concept, with a mocked \glossary{erp}.
 
 In the case that there is time left the aspects of creation of contracts and quotes based on templates and customer depending on information could be added to the workflow and the archiving of contracts regarding the regulations based from the governance and \gls{cc}. For the realization already existing tools should be used in the best case.
 
 \section{Scope}
 The focus is the creation of a process for the electronic signing of documents. Therefore, a system need to be created that connects an \gls{erp} with a tool that coordinates the document signing. Additional the writing of the bachelor thesis is part of this focus. Only in the case that time is left until the end of the internship additional functionality is to be implemented like archiving the signed documents and the template creation of contracts and quotes. The thesis is concentrate on these aspects of a \gls{cms}, because the development of a complete \gls{cms} will take more time than given through the internship. 
 
 Out of scope will be all other document types than quotes, contracts and order. They will be focused after the internship, also due to the fact that therefore more legal questions need to be clarified. 
 
 \section{Phases \& Products} \label{sec:phases}
 There are five phases in the project:
 \begin{enumerate}
 	\item Project planning
 	\item Analysis of the current situation and the requirements needed
 	\item Research about used tools 
 	\item Implementation and testing of the system based on the defined scope
 	\item Finalize bachelor thesis
 \end{enumerate}
 
 Inside these phases several products should be delivered. They are listed below:
 \begin{itemize}
 	\item Project plan
 	\item Documentation of the current situation
 	\item Research about \gls{es} and tools that could be used to sign documents electronically
 	\item A system to proof the concept, with a documentation
 	\item A report about the bachelor thesis (this document)
 \end{itemize}
 
 \section{Motivation}
 There are different motivation aspects behind the project. First of all is the reducing of work. When the steps of creating, signing and archiving of documents are automated less employee need to work in this area or they could work more effective. Next the response time gets faster regrading the concluding of contracts. And finally the guidelines of \gls{cc} must be complied by the employees due to the fact that there is an automated process based on the guidelines.
