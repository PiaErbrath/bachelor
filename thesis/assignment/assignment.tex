 This chapter gives an overview about the bachelor thesis project. Therefore the problem ans the assignment are explained, the scope and the phases are defined and finally the motivation behind the project is documented.
 
 \section{Problem Description}
 The first plan was to create a contract management system for the customer Wacom, which produces mobile devices with interactive displays that can be used to make graphics or to sign documents \footnote{https://www.wacom.com/en-de}. But currently they develop a new \gls{SDK} that will be finished earliest in July 2018.
 
 Than a contact to the Finance and Sales department was made. They currently want to setup a new \gls{erp}, because the old \gls{erp} does not fit the requirements any more. One big aspect for them is to reduce the paper work and automate or simplify several processes regarding making offers, orders and invoices, starting projects and storing data at only one point for all departments.

 \section{Assignment Description}
 The idea of the task is to introduce the \gls{es} with a general usage by \gls{cc}. Currently they use the \gls{es} partly, but not in all areas possible.
 This means that all possible contracts and offers should be signed with the \gls{es} and stored digital, so that the paperless office can be created. Included in the task is the creation of a workflow, that automates the process of subscribing regrading the signing guideline of \gls{cc} so that cost for managing could be reduced and the response time is increased.
 
 In the case that there is time left the aspects of creation of contracts and offers based on templates and customer depending information could be added to the workflow and the archiving of contracts regarding the regulations based from the governance and \gls{cc}. For the realization already existing tools should be used in the best case.
 
 \section{Scope}
 The main focus is the creation of a process for the electronic signing of documents. Additional the writing of the bachelor thesis is part of this focus. Only in the case that time is left until the end of the internship additional functionality is to be implemented like achieving the signed documents and the template creation of contracts and offers.
 
 \section{Phases \& Products} \label{sec:phases}
 There are five phases in the project:
 \begin{enumerate}
 	\item Project planning:
 	\item Analysis of the current situation and the requirements needed
 	\item Designing of a new workflow
 	\item Implementation and testing of the workflow
 	\item Finalize bachelor thesis
 \end{enumerate}
 
 Inside this phases several products should be delivered. They are listed below:
 \begin{itemize}
 	\item Project plan
 	\item Documentation of the current situation
 	\item Research about \gls{es} and tools that could be used
 	\item A documentation and implementation of the new workflow to sign documents digital
 	\item A report about the bachelor thesis (this document)
 \end{itemize}
 
% At least the workflow for subscribing documents based on regulations should be implemented in a way that the most steps are done automatically. Additional the product should be maintainable and extensible, in the sense that additional functionality could be implemented or the product integrated in the new \gls{erp}
 
 \section{Motivation}
 There are different motivation aspects behind the project. First of all is the reducing of work. When the steps of creating, signing and archiving of documents is automated less employee need to work in this area. Next the response time gets faster regrading the concluding of contracts. And finally the guidelines of \gls{cc} must be sticked by the employees due to the fact that there is an automated process based on the guidelines.
