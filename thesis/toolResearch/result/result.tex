\section{Result}
In this section different tools will be described, their test result presented and the general information of them summarized.

\subsection{Wacom sign pro PDF}
This tool is provided by the company Wacom, which is the customer previously thought for the bachelor project. At the moment there is an \gls{app} available, that signs documents with a \gls{bs} \parencite{wacom2018pdf}. Currently Wacom develops an \gls{sdk} based on the \gls{app}, therefore is no testing possible. The information presented in table \ref{tool:tab:wacom} are from the internet and a product presentation from first March 2018 at the Wacom site in DÃ¼sseldorf. \newline

Due to the fact that the knockout criteria are not fulfilled at the moment, no further research was done.

\subsection{DocuSign}
This tool is already in usage at \gls{cc}, but not always and with a lot of manual actions and missing things like the company stamp. During the testing a lot of functionalities were figured out. The test protocol is placed in the appendix \ref{tool:sec:docusign}. The table \ref{tool:tab:docusign} below will give a short summary about the test result and other aspects figured out during the research.

%\begin{table}[h!]

		\rowcolor{Gray}Criterion & Fulfillment \\ \hline
		Integration &  A \gls{sdk} available within the \grqq Business Flex\grqq packet of the provider or a higher one. Also an integration is possible with Google applications and JIRA, which are both used by \gls{cc}. \parencite{docusign2018integration,docusign2018formats,docusign2018google,docusign2018jira}. \\ \hline
		Device independent & Online available, also an \gls{app} is accessible for all \gls{os} of smartphones \parencite{docusign2018mobile}. It provides the same functionalities as the web application. \\ \hline
		Usability &  The fields need to be set manual, it need to be checked if it possible to customize it. Furthermore, it is possible to track activities, assign signer, add the company stamp, transfer the signing responsibility, decline the signing and to sign the document manual and scan it then. \\ \hline
		Costs & The signing itself costs nothing. The cost per year will be 11.823,00 \euro. Included is the \gls{api} and web application access, support, unlimited users and signers and a document retrieve. This leads to an average cost for one document of 4,93 \euro. The document retriever is included in this calculation, but due to the fact that this functionality is optional the price excluded of it is 3,37 \euro per document and this is taken into account for the later comparison to have a similar base for all tools. Additionally, an on-boarding is offered for 1.250,00 \euro (Appendix \ref{tool:sec:docusignPrice}). Documents, which are unused, will be expired. In the case the amount of documents is expended before the years end, it is possible to order new one. \\ \hline
		Accepted file formats & PDF \& Microsoft Word accepted, Open Office Writer is not accepted. Moreover, the maximum accepted size of a file is 25 \gls{mb}. \parencite{docusign2018formats}\\ \hline
		Operating mode & The tool is as \gls{saas}, \gls{op} or a combination of both available. \parencite{docusign2018op,docusign2018saas} \\ \hline
		Additional security & Access code, \gls{sms}, phone call or certificate exists for multi-factor authentication. Moreover, a knowledge based authentication is available, where an information from the past of the signer is requested. \parencite{docusign2018security} \\ \hline
		Legal aspects & DocuSign satisfies the standards of the \gls{eidas}, with the all \gls{es} types mentioned in it, and more security standards \parencite{docusign2018certificates,docusign2018legal,docusign2018es}. Moreover, it fits to the data legacy of most countries worldwide and implemented the regulations of the \gls{gdpr} \parencite{docusign2018global, docusign2018gdpr}. \\ \hline

Not all functionalities like branding and company stamp could be tested, because of the non usable test version of higher plans. The fields required for signing need to be set manual and there is not that much choice of fields. In the case the \gls{app} is used, only the creation of a signing process could be done.\\ \hline
		Costs &  Signing without costs is possible, but the creation and preparation cost. To use the \gls{api} and the web application the \gls{api} Gold Plan and the enterprise web app plan need to be paid. This will costs normally 28.420\$ per year. Included are 80 users, 450 documents sending per month and unlimited support. The cost for one document will be then 9,48\$, which is 7,92 \euro calculated based on the exchange rate from the 14th May 2018.  \ref{tool:sec:hellosignPrice} \\ \hline
		Accepted file formats & HelloSign accepts several file formats. In the test the formats \gls{PDF}, Microsoft Word and Open Office Writer was accepted. The maximal amount of pages from a document are 500 pages or a file size of 40th \gls{mb} \parencite{hellosign2018documents}.\\ \hline
		Operating mode & In general the system is available in \gls{saas} mode. \parencite{hellosign2018features} \\ \hline
