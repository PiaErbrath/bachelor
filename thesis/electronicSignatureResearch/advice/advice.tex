In general need to be said that \glspl{es} are a good alternative for handwriting signatures, especially in \gls{eu} states. The focus is on the type of \gls{es}. The result from the comparison in section \ref{es:sec:comp} is that the \gls{qes} fits the requirements explained in section \ref{Tes:ab:criteria} best. Also, from the legal aspect would it be the best solution, cause of the fact that it is equated to the written signature in the most cases. Even customers with a high demand on legal aspects will be satisfied with that signature, cause of the possibility to track document changes after the signing and the identification of the signers. But in the case the handwritten signature is not mandatory by law, the \gls{aes} is also a good solution. It is mostly also the one with lower costs and has the same functionalities as the \gls{qes} with identifying the person and tracking the content changes.
