The new business process should solve the problems explained in detail in section \ref{sec:issues}. But additional there are more requirements to the new process in the technical and formal area. An overview about the general targets and their requirements is given in table \ref{tab:overviewTargets}. They are explained afterwards in this chapter. First the targets of the new process are explained. Next the requirements are described and finally a sketch of the new process presented.

\section{Targets}
The company \gls{cc} hops that the new process can solve the problems they currently have. Therefore, they defined the following aims that should be reached with the new process:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Satisfy the signing guideline. \newline
	In the future all documents should be signed regarding the signing guideline. It should not be possible to send an unsigned or incorrect signed document to the customer. Furthermore, the employees should not think about what they need to sign with which amendment. The system implemented the new business process should predetermine the needed fields to be filled in with the information of the according content.
	\item Reduce the manual work. \newline
	The interaction with the sites of \gls{cc} should get faster and simpler. Also, the creation of the documents should be done based on templates to reach a corporate identity within all documents and reduce the formal mistakes inside of them. Moreover, the manual work should be reduced. In the best case the system automatically fill the standard information correct in and add the fields for signing without any help of the human.  
	\item Reduce the usage of paper in the office. \newline
	Due to the fact that all contracts and belonging documents are either stored electronically or need to be archived in the headquarter at Solingen. This leads to situation that the documents when the archived electronically will be disposed properly or send with the postal way to Solingen and placed there in the physical archive. In the case that this will be done mostly everything electronically, the costs will be reduced for the properly disposal, sending and the maintenance and the place of the physical archive. 
	\item Introduction of a corporate-identity: \newline
	ToDo
\end{enumerate}
The result should be that \gls{cc} can work more effectively so that the reaction time by customer requests can be speed up and unnecessary and error-prone work can be reduced due to automation by fulfilling given regulations from the government and the executive board of \gls{cc}.

\section{Requirements}
For the new process a few requirements need to be fulfilled to reach the aims defined previously and the acceptance of all employees and customers of \gls{cc}.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Defined standard process: \newline
	To keep it simple to use there should be a standard process. This is also easier to control and the teaching of it is always the same. Moreover, exceptions should be avoided, because that leads to confusion, old problems and mistakes.
	\item Accepted document formats: \newline
	At \gls{cc} currently the following document formats are used to create and store documents: \gls{PDF}, Microsoft Word and Open Office Writer. They should also be used in the new process, to avoid problems with the usage and installation of the new software for document creation. Additional it should not be to complicated too create new documents.
	\item Transparency about signing guideline: \newline
	Through the new process the signing guideline should get more transparent for the staff of \gls{cc}. This means during the creation of a document the employee should get the information if he need to inform a person from the executive board. Moreover, by the creation of the new process clear terminology definitions should be created to avoid communication and interpretation problems between the staff and the different departments of \gls{cc}.
	\item Automate the archiving of documents. \newline
	All documents should be archived regarding their content and relation to other documents. This should leads to a clear structure, which can be fast understand and simple to use for the employees working with that documents. At the end the amount of work for searching and archiving should be reduced and the processing of other tasks should get faster cause of the sorted archive.
	\item Fulfillment of the signing guideline:\newline
	The new process should make it simple to fulfill the signing guideline. In the best case all persons need to sign, based on the signing guideline should be automatically invited to sign in the correct order. This functionality requires an automatic insertion of the needed data fields like date, place and signature. With the automation it is ensured that the signing guideline is always fulfilled due to the fact that the creator of the document do not need to know who had to sign from \gls{cc}.
	\item Certain legal standard: \newline
	Another requirement is that the new process need to fulfill legal standards. This includes aspects of data protection, regulations regarding electronic signature and security aspects. Additional it need to keep care that the standards from the customer, partner and the company itself need to be satisfied. \newline
	As \gls{es} should at least the \gls{aes} be used, because it makes possible to ensure authenticity and integrity as can be seen in appendix \ref{res:es}. 
\end{enumerate}
Beside the major requirements listed above there are some nice-to-have features like one design for all documents to get a corporate identity in them. Furthermore, it will be nice when the documents could be sent about one mail address specified per responsibility like quotes and order confirmation with \textit{office@codecentitc.de}. This ensures the correct receiving of an answer from the customers. The implementation establishes a simple response functionality for the customer, because the German government determine, that the authenticity and integrity of a received document with mail need to be guaranteed.
